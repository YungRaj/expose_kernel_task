# expose_kernel_task

This project basically utilizes the kernel read/write primitive with the kernel task port exploited via tfp0 on a checkra1n'ed or any jailbroken device and provides a command line interface that provides kernel patching, introspection etc, on a device with this capability. This is just a simple implementation for my own personal skill development and progression.
